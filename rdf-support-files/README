README

This folder contains files required to deploy Ensembl RDF onto a server

*.owl, *.ttl, *.rdf must all be loaded into the triplestore to allow intelligent querying
*.js, *.property files belong to the lodestar SPARQL interface, and must copied into the appropriate place
  when building lodestar for deployment

RDF, turtle and OWL files 

When deploying Lodestar, copy the javascript files to lodestar/src/main/webapp/scripts/
Edit the property file before building a WAR to preconfigure, except in production where the application 
looks for an XML file to configure things like server connections, and your intervention isn't necessary
