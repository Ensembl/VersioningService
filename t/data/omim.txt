100050 AARSKOG SYNDROME, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
*FIELD* TX

DESCRIPTION

Aarskog syndrome is characterized by short stature and facial, limb, and
genital anomalies. One form of the disorder is X-linked (see 305400),
but there is also evidence for autosomal dominant and autosomal
recessive (227330) inheritance (summary by Grier et al., 1983).

CLINICAL FEATURES

Grier et al. (1983) reported father and 2 sons with typical Aarskog
syndrome, including short stature, hypertelorism, and shawl scrotum.
Stretchable skin was present in these patients.

INHERITANCE

Grier et al. (1983) tabulated the findings in 82 previously reported
cases of Aarskog syndrome and noted that X-linked recessive inheritance
was repeatedly suggested. However, their family had father-to-son
transmission, and a family reported by Welch (1974) had affected males
in 3 consecutive generations. Grier et al. (1983) suggested autosomal
dominant inheritance with strong sex-influence and possibly
ascertainment bias resulting from use of the shawl scrotum as a main
criterion.

Van de Vooren et al. (1983) studied a large family in which Aarskog
syndrome was segregating with variable expression in 3 generations and
with male-to-male transmission. Because 3 daughters of affected males
had no features of Aarskog syndrome and 2 sons of an affected male had
several features of the syndrome, van de Vooren et al. (1983) suggested
sex-influenced autosomal dominant inheritance.

One locus for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA1) maps to chromosome 19q13.

DESCRIPTION

Abdominal aortic aneurysm is a multifactorial disorder with multiple
genetic and environmental risk factors. The disorder may occur as part
of a heritable syndrome or in isolation (summary by Kuivaniemi et al.,
2003).

- Genetic Heterogeneity of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm

Other mapped loci for abdominal aortic aneurysm include AAA2 (609782) on
chromosome 4q31; AAA3 (611891) on chromosome 9p21; and AAA4 (614375) on
chromosome 12q13.3.
